# AI-Assisted-Code-Assesment

Our project aims is to provide AI-assisted code assessment services to help developers  improve their :
1.  Code's quality
2.  Enhance productivity and Reduce TTL
3.  Reduce chances of introducing bugs and errors

The idea is to develop a single push button solution that can be executed for every pull request and able to evaluate code quickly and accurately, offering developers customized suggestions and solutions.

Definition of Problem

Code assessment is a critical quality gate check in SDLC process that help in early discovery of mistakes in newly written code. Though they are important, at time they may also become bottlenecks for quick delivery of finished product.
1. This tool will perform initial checks of the process guidelines in place and suggest fix.
2. It will use AI to identify mistakes in PR and provide suggestions based on knowledge acquired by model through training. We can also train the mode using our own training set based past review comments in tickets belonging to our organization.
3. It will also make use of Third-Party tools like Blackduck and Sonar and display any action items
This utility will serve as an efficient solution for First Level of review that can be utilized as guardrail for upkeeping the quality of code. This will eventually lead to fewer defects and increased customer satisfaction with the product quality.
